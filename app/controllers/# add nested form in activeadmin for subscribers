# add nested form in activeadmin for subscribers
	- add the text and the video on the website. 
	- design the look of the different alerts.
	- make sure that the ajax call works all the time. 
	- make sure that the message is right according to the use case. 
	- test the different messages. 


The probleme is to flash the message automatically based on the error? 
- shall we have everything in the subcribers controller? 



class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :terms_of_service, acceptance: true, message: 'must be abided'
end
