	<h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i> All undertaken challenges must be achieved</h4>

	<p>Challenges help you discover aspects of the professional life. Applying your knowledge is key to your future success.</p>

	<h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Do your best</h4>


	<p>Send the best recommendations you can to a company. Never forget that companies rely on your expertise.</p>

	<h3 class="mb-40 margin-s">For Companies</h3>

	<h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Challenges must be honest and clearly presented.</h4>

	<p>We want to build trust and improve communication between students and companies.</p>

	<h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Challenges must improve both parties</h4>

	<p>Keep in mind that students help you achieve your goals, but they are also here to discover professional life.</p>

	<h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Students only provide recommendations</h4>

	<p>Students cannot be held liable for the recommendations they provide. They always try to do their best.</p>

	<p class="margin-s">These rules donâ€™t cover every possible use of Workshopr, but they explain our purpose and perspective.</p>
